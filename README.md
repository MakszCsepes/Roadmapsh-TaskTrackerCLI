Task (https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)

Task tracker is a project used to track and manage your tasks. In this task, you will build a simple command line interface (CLI) to track what you need to do, what you have done, and what you are currently working on. 
This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with the filesystem, handling user inputs, and building a simple CLI application.

Requirements
The application should run from the command line, accept user actions and inputs as arguments, and store the tasks in a JSON file. The user should be able to:

    Add, Update, and Delete tasks
    Mark a task as in progress or done
    List all tasks
    List all tasks that are done
    List all tasks that are not done
    List all tasks that are in progress


Example.
# Adding a new task
task-cli add "Buy groceries"
# Output: Task added successfully (ID: 1)

# Updating and deleting tasks
task-cli update 1 "Buy groceries and cook dinner"
task-cli delete 1

# Marking a task as in progress or done
task-cli mark-in-progress 1
task-cli mark-done 1

# Listing all tasks
task-cli list

# Listing tasks by status
task-cli list done
task-cli list todo
task-cli list in-progress


Run the App.
